## Brand Usage Guidelines

### Voice & Tone Examples

**Homepage Hero Section:**
✅ GOOD: "Knoxville's Most Trusted House Cleaning Service - Starting at $160"
❌ BAD: "The Ultimate Cleaning Experience" (too vague)

**Service Description:**
✅ GOOD: "Our regular cleaning includes dusting, vacuuming, and bathroom sanitizing."
❌ BAD: "We utilize advanced methodologies to optimize cleanliness." (too corporate)

**Call-to-Action:**
✅ GOOD: "Get Your Free Quote in 60 Seconds"
❌ BAD: "Contact Us Today" (not specific enough)

### Messaging Consistency

**Always Include:**
- 4.8-star rating when mentioning reviews
- "Knoxville" in location references
- Specific pricing when discussing services
- "Family-owned" or "locally operated" when relevant
- Eco-friendly/safe for pets when discussing products

**Never Say:**
- "Cheapest" (we compete on value, not price)
- "Best" without proof (use "highest-rated" with our 4.8 stars)
- "Perfect" (unrealistic, use "exceptional" or "thorough")
- "Always available" (we have 2-3 day lead time)
