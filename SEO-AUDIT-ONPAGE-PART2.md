## Keyword Cannibalization Report

### Issue 1: "cleaning service Knoxville" Overlap
**Severity:** MODERATE

**Competing Pages:**
1. **index.astro** - "house cleaning service Knoxville TN" (primary)
2. **maid-service-knoxville.astro** - "maid service Knoxville" (overlaps with "cleaning service Knoxville")
3. **best-cleaning-service-knoxville.astro** - "best cleaning service Knoxville" (direct overlap)

**Analysis:**
- All three pages target variants of "cleaning service Knoxville"
- Homepage: 4 instances of "cleaning service Knoxville"
- Maid service page: Estimated 8-10 instances
- Best cleaning page: Unknown

**Impact:**
- Medium risk of keyword cannibalization
- Search engines may struggle to determine which page to rank for "cleaning service Knoxville"
- Could dilute ranking power across pages

**Resolution:**
1. **Homepage:** Keep "cleaning service Knoxville" as SECONDARY keyword (reduce to 2-3 instances)
2. **Maid Service page:** Focus exclusively on "maid service Knoxville" (reduce "cleaning service" to 1-2 mentions)
3. **Best Cleaning page:** Own "best cleaning service Knoxville" as PRIMARY keyword (15-20 instances)
4. **Strategy:** Differentiate with modifiers:
   - Homepage: "professional house cleaning service Knoxville"
   - Maid: "maid service" or "housekeeping service"
   - Best: "best cleaning service" or "top-rated cleaning service"

---

### Issue 2: Location Page Overlap - West Knoxville Services
**Severity:** LOW

**Competing Pages:**
1. **locations/west-knoxville.astro** - "house cleaning West Knoxville"
2. **locations/farragut.astro** - "cleaning service Farragut TN"
3. **locations/bearden.astro** - "house cleaning Bearden"

**Analysis:**
- Farragut and Bearden are neighborhoods WITHIN West Knoxville
- All three pages mention similar neighborhoods and overlap geographically
- West Knoxville page references: "Farragut, Bearden, Cedar Bluff, Rocky Hill"
- Risk of competing for same local searches

**Impact:**
- Low risk due to specific location modifiers
- Could confuse users about which page to visit
- Internal linking could create confusion

**Resolution:**
1. **Clear hierarchy:**
   - West Knoxville page = Main location hub
   - Farragut/Bearden = Specific neighborhood pages
2. **West Knoxville page should:**
   - Link prominently to Farragut and Bearden pages
   - Use "serving Farragut and Bearden" language (not own those keywords)
3. **Farragut/Bearden pages should:**
   - Own their specific keywords completely
   - Mention West Knoxville as broader area context
   - Include unique neighborhood content
4. **Internal linking structure:**
   - West Knoxville ‚Üí Farragut (anchor: "Farragut cleaning service")
   - West Knoxville ‚Üí Bearden (anchor: "Bearden house cleaning")
   - Farragut/Bearden ‚Üí West Knoxville (breadcrumb or context link)

### Issue 3: Deep Cleaning vs Move Out Cleaning
**Severity:** LOW

**Competing Pages:**
1. **services/deep-cleaning.astro** - "deep cleaning service Knoxville"
2. **services/move-out-cleaning.astro** - "move out cleaning service Knoxville"

**Analysis:**
- Move-out cleaning includes deep cleaning services
- Both pages likely mention "thorough cleaning," "comprehensive cleaning"
- Some overlap in LSI keywords (baseboards, appliances, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Very low risk - distinct user intent
- Users searching for move-out cleaning want specific service
- Users searching for deep cleaning may or may not be moving

**Resolution:**
1. **Keep pages separate** (correct approach)
2. **Cross-link appropriately:**
   - Deep cleaning page: "For move-out situations, see our move-out cleaning service"
   - Move-out page: "We provide deep cleaning as part of all move-out services"
3. **Differentiate content focus:**
   - Deep cleaning: Seasonal, spring cleaning, neglected homes
   - Move-out: Security deposit, landlord inspection, real estate transactions
4. **No keyword changes needed** - proper differentiation already exists
