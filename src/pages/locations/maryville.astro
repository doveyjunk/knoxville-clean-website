            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Maryville is about 15-20 miles south of Knoxville—just a quick drive down Alcoa Highway (US-129). While we're based in the greater Knoxville area, we proudly serve Maryville, Alcoa, and the surrounding communities. We understand the unique needs of Maryville residents, from seasonal pollen that comes with living near the Smoky Mountains to the dirt and debris tracked in from outdoor adventures. We're local to the area and committed to serving the entire community.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes! Maryville's location as a gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains makes it a popular spot for vacation rentals. We offer fast, reliable turnover cleaning for short-term rentals, Airbnb properties, and vacation homes. We can work around your guest check-in/check-out schedule, provide before-and-after photos for your records, and ensure your rental is spotless for every arrival. Same-day service is often available for urgent turnovers.

              What cleaning challenges are common in Maryville homes?
            </h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Maryville homes face unique cleaning challenges due to the area's proximity to the Smoky Mountains and the active outdoor lifestyle. We regularly deal with mountain dirt and red clay tracked inside, heavy pollen during spring allergy season, dust from nearby hiking trails, and debris from outdoor activities like camping and fishing. Our team understands these local conditions and has the right tools and techniques to keep your Maryville home clean year-round, no matter what the mountains throw at you.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes! Spring and fall allergy seasons can be rough in Maryville due to pollen from the surrounding mountains and trees. Our <a href="/deep-cleaning" class="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800 font-semibold">deep cleaning service</a> is perfect for allergy season—we thoroughly dust all surfaces, clean window sills where pollen accumulates, vacuum with HEPA filtration, and use eco-friendly products that won't trigger sensitivities. Many Maryville families schedule deep cleans in March/April and again in September/October to stay ahead of seasonal allergens.
