          Understanding the unique character of Bearden's established homes and varied architecture

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Bearden is known for its established neighborhoods with homes built primarily between the 1940s and 1980s. These aren't cookie-cutter new construction homes—they have character, personality, and architectural details that make them special. But they also require thoughtful cleaning approaches that respect their age and unique features.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Our team understands how to care for original hardwood floors without damaging the finish, clean vintage tile work in older bathrooms, gently dust crown molding and historic trim, and handle delicate fixtures that have been in place for decades. We know that older homes often have quirks—uneven floors, tight spaces, unique layouts—and we work efficiently in these charming spaces without taking shortcuts.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Varied Home Sizes - From Cottages to Family Homes</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            One of Bearden's greatest charms is its variety. You'll find cozy cottages and bungalows near the Village, mid-sized ranch homes in West Hills, larger two-story family homes in Colonial Village, and everything in between. Home sizes range from under 1,200 square feet to over 3,000 square feet, and we have experience with them all.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Whether you live in a compact 1950s ranch that needs efficient cleaning or a spacious family home with multiple levels and living areas, we provide customized service based on your home's specific layout and size. Our pricing is transparent and fair, reflecting the actual square footage and cleaning needs—not inflated because of your desirable Bearden address.
