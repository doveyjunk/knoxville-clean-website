## Core UI/UX Design Principles

### Visual Design Hierarchy

- **Typography Scale**: Ensure clear hierarchical relationships between headings (h1-h6) and body text
- **Spacing & Rhythm**: Check consistent use of whitespace, padding, and margins (typically 8px grid system)
- **Color Theory**: Analyze color palette for contrast ratios, brand consistency, and visual harmony
- **Visual Weight**: Evaluate balance between elements, focal points, and call-to-action prominence

### Layout & Composition

- **Grid Systems**: Verify proper use of grid layouts and column structures
- **Alignment**: Check for consistent alignment patterns (left, center, right, justified)
- **Proximity**: Related elements should be grouped together with appropriate spacing
- **Balance**: Assess symmetrical vs asymmetrical balance in composition
- **F-Pattern/Z-Pattern**: Verify content follows natural eye-tracking patterns

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Verify mobile experience is optimized, not just shrunk desktop
- **Breakpoints**: Check logical breakpoints (typically 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1536px)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile touch interactions
- **Flexible Images**: Images should scale properly without distortion
- **Content Priority**: Most important content visible without scrolling on mobile

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Color Contrast**: Text contrast minimum 4.5:1 (normal text), 3:1 (large text 18pt+)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states for all interactive elements (3:1 contrast)
- **Alternative Text**: All images have descriptive alt text
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, ARIA labels
- **Form Labels**: All form inputs have associated labels
- **Skip Navigation**: Skip links for keyboard users to bypass repetitive content

### User Experience Patterns

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show most important information first, reveal details on demand
- **Feedback & Affordances**: Clear visual feedback for interactions (hover, active, disabled states)
- **Error Prevention**: Validate inputs, provide helpful error messages
- **Consistency**: UI patterns consistent across all pages
- **Cognitive Load**: Minimize mental effort required to complete tasks
- **Familiar Patterns**: Use established conventions (logo top-left, search top-right, etc.)

### Performance & Loading

- **Perceived Performance**: Loading indicators, skeleton screens, progressive enhancement
- **Image Optimization**: Appropriate formats (WebP), lazy loading, responsive images
- **Font Loading**: System fonts or optimized web fonts with fallbacks
- **Above-the-Fold**: Critical content loads first without layout shifts
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Minimize unexpected layout movements

### Conversion Optimization (CRO)

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary CTAs stand out with contrasting colors and size
- **White Space**: CTAs have breathing room, not cluttered
- **Value Proposition**: Clear, benefit-focused messaging above the fold
- **Trust Signals**: Reviews, badges, guarantees prominently displayed
- **Friction Reduction**: Minimal form fields, clear next steps
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials, case studies, customer counts visible

### Design System Compliance

Reference the design system documentation at `/context/hero-design-system.md` for:

- **Design Tokens**: Colors, spacing, typography scales, shadows
- **Component Patterns**: Approved component usage and variations
- **Interaction States**: Hover, focus, active, disabled specifications
- **Brand Guidelines**: Logo usage, color palette, voice and tone
- **Accessibility Standards**: System-specific accessibility requirements

Validate that all implementations follow established system conventions and don't introduce inconsistencies.

## 7-Phase Review Process
