#### 4. Fix Homepage Meta Description
**Current Issue:** 213 characters - cuts off phone number (primary CTA)

**File:** `/Users/brycedovenbarger/Documents/Projects/heroweb/cleaning-business-site/src/pages/index.astro`
**Line:** 3

**Before:**
```astro
const pageDescription = "Professional house cleaning service in Knoxville TN with transparent pricing. Regular cleaning $160, Deep cleaning $330. 4.8★ rating, 175+ reviews. Same-day availability. Call (865) 507-1405 for your free quote.";

const pageDescription = "Professional house cleaning in Knoxville TN. $160 regular, $330 deep cleaning. 4.8★ rating, 175+ reviews. Same-day available. Call (865) 507-1405";
```

**Impact:** Critical - ensures phone number displays on most important page

---

#### 5. Update "How Much Does House Cleaning Cost" Year + Length
**Current Issue:** Shows 2024 (outdated), 84 characters (too long)

**File:** `/Users/brycedovenbarger/Documents/Projects/heroweb/cleaning-business-site/src/pages/how-much-does-house-cleaning-cost.astro`
**Line:** 4

**Before:**
```astro
const pageTitle = "How Much Does House Cleaning Cost in Knoxville? (2024 Guide) | Hero House Cleaning";
```

**After:**
```astro
const pageTitle = "House Cleaning Cost Knoxville 2025 | Hero";
```

**Impact:** Updates to current year, prevents truncation, maintains keyword focus

## Batch Fix Recommendations

### All Location Pages Title Pattern
**Current Pattern:** "[Service] [Location] | [Long Description] | Hero House Cleaning" (80-94 chars)

**Recommended Pattern:** "[Service] [Location] | Hero" (35-45 chars)

**Files to Update:**
1. `/src/pages/locations/west-knoxville.astro` - Line: TBD
2. `/src/pages/locations/farragut.astro` - Line: TBD
3. `/src/pages/locations/oak-ridge.astro` - Line: 4
4. `/src/pages/locations/bearden.astro` - Line: TBD
5. `/src/pages/locations/maryville.astro` - Line: TBD

**Example Fix:**
```astro
// Before
const pageTitle = "House Cleaning West Knoxville | Professional Maid Service | Hero House Cleaning";

// After
const pageTitle = "House Cleaning West Knoxville | Hero";
```

---

### All Location Pages Meta Description Pattern
**Current Pattern:** Too location-specific details, 180-193 characters

**Recommended Pattern:** "Cleaning service in [Location] serving [2-3 neighborhoods]. [USP]. Trusted by [social proof]. Call (865) 507-1405" (140-155 chars)

**Example Fix:**
```astro
// Before
const pageDescription = "Professional house cleaning service in Bearden serving Bearden Village, West Hills, Northshore & all Bearden neighborhoods. Same-day availability. Call (865) 507-1405 for a free quote!";

// After
const pageDescription = "House cleaning in Bearden serving Bearden Village, West Hills & Northshore. Same-day availability. Trusted since 2020. Call (865) 507-1405";
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### How to Apply Fixes in Astro

All fixes are in the frontmatter section at the top of each `.astro` file:

```astro
---
const pageTitle = "Your optimized title here";
const pageDescription = "Your optimized description here";
---
```

These variables are passed to the Layout component:

```astro
<Layout title={pageTitle} description={pageDescription}>
```

Or directly as props:

```astro
<Layout
  title="Title here"
  description="Description here"
>
```

### Testing After Changes

1. **Check character count:** Use online SEO tools or character counters
2. **Preview in SERPs:** Use Google's SERP preview tool
3. **Validate schema:** Use Google's Rich Results Test
4. **Check mobile display:** Titles truncate earlier on mobile (~50 chars)

---
